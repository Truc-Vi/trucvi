# About me
Hi, my name is Trúc Vi. I’ve been working in data for 1 year. For me, data is a job that requires attention to detail and strong logic. Although my current role is not yet that of a professional Data Analyst, I believe that my ability to apply tools and analytical skills helps make my work easier.
I hope my experience will meet the requirements of the position I’m applying for. I’m willing to learn and improve to fill in any skill gaps and meet all job requirements.
